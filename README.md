### Methods Used
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* LightGBM


### Technologies
* Python
* Selenium 
* Flask
* HTML
* CSS


## Project Description
We pulled our data using the package baseball_scraper which provides play level information on historical baseball games going back to 2013.

## Needs of this project

- frontend developer
- data exploration
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- automation of pick submission

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is obtained from the get_data.py script    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. Downlaod the appropriate Google Chrome Driver [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
5. Install required packages from [requirement.txt](https://github.com/nedhulseman/bts2/blob/main/requirements.txt)

## File Descriptions
1. Main.py completes the gathering and manipulation of data for both training and deployment for time period of interest.
2. Main_train.py trains the models models using given a start date and end date provided. 
3. App.py spins up application to see current and previous results and predicted probabilities.

## Data Dictionary
The data is obtained using the package [baseball-scraper] (https://pypi.org/project/baseball-scraper/). The data dictionary for the raw variables can be found [here](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs).
